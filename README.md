# Indian Agriculture Data Analysis

This project performs analytics on the Indian Agriculture dataset provided by the National Data and Analytics Platform, NITI Aayog. The analysis includes identifying the crop with the maximum and minimum production for each year from 1950 to 2020 and calculating the average yield and cultivation area for each crop over the same period. The results are displayed using Mantine components.
